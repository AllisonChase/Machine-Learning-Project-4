### Data Model Implementation
The Python script in "Machine_Learning.ipynb" initializes, trains, and evaluates a model using data from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' data set on nursing home provider information. This data set covers “general information on currently active nursing homes, including number of certified beds, quality measure scores, staffing, and other information in the Five-Star Rating System” in the United States (https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py).
Our data was cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling.
Our model utilizes data retrieved from SQL.
Our model demonstrated a meaningful predictive power of 79% classification accuracy.

### Data Model Optimization

"Data/Model Progression.xlsx" shows iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance.
Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script  in "Machine_Learning.ipynb".
